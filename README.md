## 🚀 Overview

**Global Wanderlust Planner** is an AI-powered travel planning web application that creates **personalized, budget-aware, and country-intelligent travel itineraries**.

Unlike basic itinerary generators, this planner:
- Adjusts costs intelligently based on the destination country  
- Explains *why* a plan was created (LLM-style reasoning)  
- Asks smart follow-up questions to refine the journey  
- Integrates frontend, backend, and LLM in a clean architecture

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Reasoning Message**  
  Explains:
  - Why this itinerary was chosen  
  - How the budget was handled  
  - What trade-offs were made  

- 🌎 **Country-Based Cost Scaling**  
  Automatically adapts pricing for:
  - India, USA, Europe, Japan, etc.  
  - Stay, food, transport, and activities  

- 🔁 **Smart Follow-Up Questions**  
  The agent asks:
  - Want a cheaper or luxury version?  
  - Add adventure / culture / relaxation?  
  - Change number of days?  

- 🎨 **Dark-Themed Modern UI**  
  Clean, minimal, and user-friendly interface.

- 🔗 **End-to-End Integration**
